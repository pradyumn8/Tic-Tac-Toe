# Tic Tac Toe with React

## Overview

Welcome to the **Tic Tac Toe** game built with React! This project is a simple and interactive implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, showcasing React's component-based architecture and state management capabilities.

## Features

- **Interactive Game Board**: Click on cells to place your move. The game board updates in real-time.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players 'O' and 'X' alternate turns.
- **Winner Detection**: The game identifies the winner or declares a draw when no moves are left.
- **Game Reset**: Reset the game easily to start a new round.

## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Two players take turns to mark a cell on the grid with 'O' or 'X'.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
